# NLP Implementations
Implementing various NLP model architectures and algorithms from scratch as exercises to deepen my understanding of natural language processing and how these models work "under the hood".

## Projects

### RNN for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- **Location**: `architectures/rnn_sentiment_analysis`
- **Objective**: Implement a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments.
- **Techniques Used**: RNN, Word Embeddings, Sentiment Analysis
- **Results/Outcome**: Gained insights into the workings of RNNs and their effectiveness in processing sequential data like text.
