# NLP Implementations
Implementing various NLP model architectures and algorithms from scratch as exercises to deepen my understanding of natural language processing and how these models work "under the hood".

## Projects

### RNN for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- **Location**: [RNN-Sentiment-Analysis/](https://github.com/dtiourine/nlp-implementations/tree/main/RNN-Sentiment-Analysis)
- **Objective**: Implement a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments.
- **Techniques Used**: RNN, Word Embeddings, Sentiment Analysis
- **Results/Outcome**: Gained insights into the workings of RNNs and their effectiveness in processing sequential data like text.
