# NLP Implementations
Implementing various NLP model architectures and algorithms from scratch as exercises to deepen my understanding of natural language processing and how these models work "under the hood".

## Projects

### RNN for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- **Location**: `models/rnn_sentiment_analysis`
- **Objective**: Implement a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments.
